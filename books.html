	<img src="dataMining.jpg" class="float_l" width="250" height="auto"/><p style="margin-left:270px;">Data mining is one of the most important topics that have witnessed a great development in recent years, especially after the great development of the Internet. This book includes six chapters that describe the theoretical and practical aspects of data mining. This book includes a large part of the business applications because of the wide spread of this subject, especially after the great development of communications and the Internet and the entry of the business world in a clear and big competition and the best way to reach sustainable and effective competition.
	This book addresses several important topics in the Data Mining field such as:
	Chapter one clarified the general concepts about data, information, knowledge and how to discover data, in addition to the difference between the databases and the huge data warehouse and how to explore it with some applications on the data warehouse.
	Chapter two explained how to obtain the data readiness, in addition to data types and the types of measurements used in data, such as the parameters of central tendency and dispersion, as well as some necessary applications using the Matlab package.
	Chapter three discussed the initial processing of data, which includes data classification and data cleaning and removal of undesirable data in addition to understanding how to implement the processes of redundancy, correlation and data integration, as well as explained the analysis of the basic components and histograms and has been enriched this chapter with many applications.
	Chapter four focused on the exploration of recurrent patterns. The concept of frequently patterns and this issue is clarified and enriched with the basic algorithms for data mining, while clarifying the methods used to evaluate these patterns.
	Chapter five discussed the classification of data, methods and mathematical equations used, as well as the method of extrapolating and building the decision tree and extracting the basic rules from the decision tree. In addition, some related algorithms, such as the sequencing algorithm, the genetic algorithm and the fuzzy logic algorithm.
	Chapter six concentrated on clustering analysis including identification and the application of clustering analysis methods, as well as the methods of fragmentation and structuring. In addition, explained various methods of statistical information network.
	The main feature of this book that it has set of important applications for each chapter was supported by many examples and many important questions for each subject. What distinguishes this manuscript is the lack of Arabic library for this type of books.
	We offer to the reader this modest manuscript, which has been prepared in a way that fits with the subject that was reviewed in its theoretical and practical aspects and thus we have achieved part of our mission in delivering science and knowledge to the reader.</p>
