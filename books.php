	<p style="margin-left:270px;">
	The Arabian Peninsula (Al-Jazirah Al-Arabiya) has always been a center for many historical events. The Arabian Peninsula is known for its unique location on the most important main roads in the world between the East and the West. Throughout the times, many known civilizations with great impact on history arose in the region. Those civilizations are characterized by many advanced achievements that had a great impact on the development of mankind throughout history. The most prominent of which were the laws of rulers, laws systems, engineering sciences, astronomy, weather, medicine and surgery, architecture, construction of dams, and the construction of irrigation canals. In addition to enriching mankind with knowledge related to agriculture, industry, trade, and its sciences, the region was the source of the first foundations of writing. <br />

	Given a large number of successive civilizations in the Arab region and the difficulty of addressing them all, the book selects certain civilizations that had an important role in enriching humanity and whose effects are still visible today. Some of those civilizations include the Sumerian, Akkadian, Babylonian, Assyrian, Pharaonic, and Yemeni civilizations. The book also addresses other topics that greatly influenced the course of events in those civilizations; for example, the pre-Islamic era and Islamic caliphates such as the Umayyad, Abbasid, and Fatimid caliphates. The book also highlights the role of Arabs in carrying civilization to Andalusia and the role of Syriacs in the emergence of Arab civilization. Finally, the book acknowledges the role of women in the mentioned civilizations. <br />

	This book is based on established facts and information the author obtained through research in many approved Arab and foreign sources. The book is rich in knowledge not only in terms of history but also in terms of the relationship with religions and arts in the mentioned civilizations. The book also contains many maps and pictures that support the credibility of the content. The author hopes that this book can be used as a textbook in relevant universities, colleges, and institutes, in addition to being an asset for specialists in Arab civilization, antiquities, and culture.

	<p style="margin-left:270px;">
	Traditional organizations today are on the way to decay as a result of technological development, without these developments, an organization today cannot continue and survive because competition in today's market depends on the acceleration of events and the speed of information arriving at the right time in order to be effective in making efficient decisions. All this development prompted today's organizations to adapt to the new and changing environment in order to find a way for them in the global market, where competition is fiercest, while products have increased and diversified greatly. <br />

	This era witnessed a great and important turn in business organizations and the events they practice. New concepts and terms appeared that mimic this era, including the electronic organization, the virtual organization, business information systems, strategic information systems, electronic markets, virtual markets, and institutional electronic systems that help in managing and running all the work of the institution from operations to administrative functions to the rest of the Foundation's activities and it facilitates all the work of the foundation as it is a large store for the Foundation's data and information, in addition to it follows up on all institutional work on a timely basis. <br />

	This manuscript will address the modern business organization and its requirements and how to adapt and manage them using modern information systems. In addition, all the information systems needed by the business organization will be reviewed and how to integrate these systems into a unified institutional system that provides the organization with all the information it needs. This manuscript has been characterized by bringing the concepts closer to the Arab reader, as well as adapting the concepts to be clear to the reader. The manuscript contains a large number of questions that help the reader to self-examine and check his knowledge gained from reading the manuscript.
