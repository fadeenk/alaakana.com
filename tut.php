  I am  a native Arabic speaker. I was born and raised in the Middle East. Throughout my life, I have  lived in Iraq, Jordan. I obtained Ph.D degree in Management in 2009. I worked  as a professor for more than ten years in several universities in Iraq and Jordan  before coming to the United States. <br /></p>
  <p>In the United States, I worked with San Diego State  University (SDSU) as Role Player and manuscript editor for  SDSU Research Foundation. I also worked as  Assistant Instructor in California State University - Long Beach. Recently, I have been working in National University. I have an experience as an Arabic teacher, private tutor, and  translator who has worked with students from various backgrounds in different  countries. I have an intensive knowledge of formal Arabic; reading and writing fluently with a strong understanding of the major Arabic dialects  (slang). In addition, I have taught several graduate and undergraduate classes  in well-known universities.</p>
  <p>I'm  passionate about sharing knowledge and teaching. I find it very interesting and  special to be able to teach my native Arabic language to non-native speakers by  using different, effective methods of teaching, such as the cooperative way  that I was taught in an intensive course in this regard. I prefer to teach with  an emphasis on conversation, and use textbooks materials to help establishing a  strong foundation.</p>
